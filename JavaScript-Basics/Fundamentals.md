### JavaScript Fundamentals : Part 2

#### 1.Comparisons 
- Comparison operators return a boolean value.
- Strings are compared letter-by-letter in the “dictionary” order.
- A comparison result can be assigned to a variable, just like any value
- When comparing values of different types, JavaScript converts the values to numbers.
- The values null and undefined equal == each other and do not equal any other value.
- Strict equality is strict. Different types from both sides lead to false.
- Be careful when using comparisons like > or < with variables that can occasionally be null/undefined. Checking for null/undefined separately is a good idea.

### 3. Logical Operators
- There are four logical operators in JavaScript: || (OR), && (AND), ! (NOT), ?? (Nullish Coalescing)
- Although they are called “logical”, they can be applied to values of any type, not only boolean. Their result can also be of any type.
- The precedence of AND && operator is higher than OR ||.
